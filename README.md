# Advent of code 2024 in Rust

Some so-so Rust code related to the [2024 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).

Like in [2021](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2021_rust), in [2022](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2022_rust), and in [2023](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2023_rust), I'm trying to keep the code as simple as possible, and I'm not using any fancy features of Rust.
